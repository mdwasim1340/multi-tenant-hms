## 🚨 ANTI-DUPLICATION GUIDELINES

### Before Creating New Features
1. **Search existing components**: Use `find . -name "*feature-name*" -type f`
2. **Check for legacy implementations**: Review cleanup summaries in `backend/docs/`
3. **Remove old versions**: Clean up legacy code before implementing new features
4. **Document changes**: Update cleanup summaries when removing old code

### Current Clean Architecture (Post-Cleanup)
- **Tenant Management**: Single modern system in `/components/tenants/` (legacy removed)
- **Subscription System**: Integrated billing and usage tracking
- **No Duplicates**: 739 lines of legacy tenant code removed (Nov 4, 2025)

### ✅ Authentication System

## Architecture

The system implements a middleware-based Express.js backend with:
- Tenant isolation through database schema separation
- JWT-based authentication using AWS Cognito
- S3 integration for secure file storage
- RESTful API design with comprehensive error handling

## Key Business Rules

- All API requests (except auth endpoints) require tenant context via `X-Tenant-ID` header
- Each tenant operates in complete isolation - no cross-tenant data access
- File uploads are automatically prefixed with tenant ID for isolation
- User authentication is handled through AWS Cognito user pools
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour for security
- Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour to prevent unauthorized access
