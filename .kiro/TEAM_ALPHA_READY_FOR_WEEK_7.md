- Doctor creates appointment
- Orders lab tests during visit
- Lab order linked to appointment
- Results available in appointment context

**2. Lab Results → Medical Record**
- Lab results completed
- Automatically attached to medical record
- Doctor reviews in patient record
- Results inform treatment decisions

**3. Appointment → Medical Record**
- Appointment completed
- Medical record created/updated
- Lab orders and results linked
- Complete patient history maintained

### Data Flow
```
Patient
  ├── Appointments
  │   ├── Lab Orders
  │   │   └── Lab Results
  │   └── Medical Records
  │       └── Attachments (S3)
  └── Complete History
```
