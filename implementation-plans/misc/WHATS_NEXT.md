## 💡 My Recommendation

### **Start with Option A: Week 3 (Medical Records)**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Natural Flow**: Completes the patient journey
   - Patient Registration → Appointment → Medical Record
   
2. **High Value**: Core clinical functionality
   - Doctors need to record diagnoses
   - Treatment plans are essential
   - Prescription foundation needed
   
3. **Enables Next Steps**: Foundation for Week 4
   - Prescriptions need medical records
   - Lab tests link to medical records
   - Complete clinical workflow
   
4. **Maintains Momentum**: Keep backend team focused
   - Consistent patterns from Weeks 1-2
   - Same team, same approach
   - Proven velocity

### **Then Follow With**:
1. **Week 4**: Prescriptions & Lab Tests (completes backend core)
2. **Team B Week 1**: Patient UI (parallel with Week 4)
3. **Team B Week 2**: Appointment UI (parallel with backend)
4. **Team C Week 1**: RBAC (security layer)
5. **Team D Week 1**: Testing infrastructure
