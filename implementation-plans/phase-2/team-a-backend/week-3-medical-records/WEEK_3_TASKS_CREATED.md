## 📊 Progress
- **Created**: 3 tasks
- **Remaining**: 14 tasks
- **Completion**: 18%

## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete Week 3 task creation, I need to create 14 more task files following the same pattern as Weeks 1 & 2.

**Estimated time to create remaining tasks**: ~1.5 hours

**Would you like me to**:
1. Continue creating all remaining Week 3 tasks now
2. Create them day-by-day (4 tasks at a time)
3. Pause and review what's been created so far

## 📋 Task Pattern Established

All tasks follow the proven pattern:
- ✅ Clear objective
- ✅ Estimated time
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions with complete code
- ✅ Verification steps
- ✅ Commit instructions
- ✅ Success criteria

## 🔗 Integration Points

Week 3 integrates with:
- **Week 1 (Patients)**: Medical records reference patients
- **Week 2 (Appointments)**: Medical records link to appointments
- **Week 4 (Prescriptions)**: Foundation for prescription management

## 🎉 What's Ready

The foundation for Week 3 is solid:
- ✅ Database schema designed (4 tables, 18 indexes)
- ✅ TypeScript models defined (comprehensive interfaces)
- ✅ Zod validation schemas created (business rules)
- ✅ Task structure documented
- ✅ Integration points identified

**Ready to complete the remaining 14 tasks!**
